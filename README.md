Usage: ruby xml_to_html.rb <taxonomy XML file> <destinations XML file> <output directory that contains static/all.css>

For this specific case one can run: "ruby xml_to_html.rb taxonomy.xml destinations.xml output"

In addition to the stated requirements, I also added hyperlinks for text URLs in the content.

Tested on Ruby 2.1.2p95
