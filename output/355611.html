<h3>Introductory</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Travel Alert: Crime is a problem throughout South Africa; see the Health &amp; Safety section for details.It’s no wonder that South Africa draws more visitors than anywhere else in sub-Saharan Africa. World-class wildlife-watching, cosmopolitan cities like the great big beating heart of Johannesburg, stunning natural panoramas from Table Mountain National Park and vibrant cultures make the country appealing to almost every taste and budget. Geographically, its extremes include the arid semidesert of the Karoo, the snowcapped peaks of the Drakensberg Range, the lush subtropical coast of KwaZulu-Natal and the fertile temperate valleys of Western Cape. Within the space of a day, you can journey from vineyard-clad hillsides in the Western Cape to the vast open spaces of the Kalahari; from waterfront chic in Cape Town to isolated Zulu villages; from elephant-spotting in Kruger National Park to the sublime seascapes of the coast.

While it’s easy to focus on the glitz and developed infrastructure, you’ll only get below the surface by seeking out the country’s other face – most visible in the sprawling townships where far too many people live stalked by the shadows of hunger, poverty and one of the highest HIV/AIDS infection rates in the world. Behind its incredible natural beauty, South Africa is the stage for the daily drama of one of the world’s greatest  experiments in racial harmony. The intensity of this drama surrounds you wherever you go, and is likely to be one of the most fascinating and challenging aspects of your travels.

<h3>History</h3>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>The earliest recorded inhabitants of this area of Africa were the San (Bushmen) and the closely related Khoikhoi (Hottentots). The next arrivals were Bantu-speaking tribes who, by the 11th century, had settled the northeast and the east coast and, by the 15th century, most of the eastern half of South Africa. These tribes were pastoral but had trade links throughout the region. They were Iron Age peoples, and the smelting techniques of some tribes were not surpassed in Europe until the Industrial Revolution.The Dutch East India Company established the first European settlement in South Africa at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. The settlers developed a close-knit community with their own dialect (Afrikaans) and Calvinist sect (the Dutch Reformed Church). Slaves were imported from other parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.Over the next 150 years, the colonists spread east, coming into violent contact with Bantu tribes. In 1779 the eastward expansion of the Boers (Dutch-Afrikaner farmers) was temporarily halted by the Xhosa in the first Bantu War.Further Boer expansion was hastened after the British annexed the Cape in 1806. The abolition of slavery in 1834 was regarded by the Boers as an intolerable interference in their affairs, and led to migration across the Orange River two years later. This became known as the Great Trek.Pressure on the Bantu from both the Boers and the British caused political and social changes among the tribes of the Natal area, resulting in the rise of the Zulu king, Shaka, in the early 19th century. His policy of total war on neighbouring tribes caused immense suffering and mass migration in a period known as the difaqane (the scattering).The Boers came into this chaos in search of new lands, and the British were not far behind them. The Zulu were eventually defeated, but relations between the Boers and the British remained tense – particularly after the formation of the Boer republics of the Free State and the Transvaal.Diamonds were discovered in 1867 at Kimberley, followed by the discovery of gold in 1886 on the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg (Jo’burg). The Boer republics were flooded with British capital and immigrants, which created resentment among Boer farmers.The British imperialist Cecil Rhodes encouraged a rebellion among the heavily taxed – but nonvoting – English-speaking miners in the Transvaal, with a view to destabilising the Boer republics and encouraging British intervention. The resulting tensions led to the 1899–1902 Anglo-Boer War.The war ended with the defeat of the Boer republics and the imposition of British rule over the whole country. Britain had pursued a scorched-earth policy to combat Boer guerrillas, destroying homes, crops and livestock. During this time more than 26,000 Afrikaner women and children died in the world’s first concentration camps.</p>
<h5>History</h5>
<p>In 1910 the Union of South Africa was created, which gave political control to the whites. Inevitably, this prompted black resistance in the form of strikes, and political organisations were formed. Despite the moderate tone of these early resistance groups, the government reacted by intensifying repression.The Afrikaner National Party won the election in 1948. It went even further in excluding nonwhites from having any political or economic power, and the security forces brutally enforced its laws. Violence was a routine method of reaction to any opposition or protest. The suppression of black resistance ranged from the Sharpeville massacre of 1960 and the shooting of school children in Soweto in 1976, to the forcible evacuation and bulldozing of squatter settlements and the systematic torture – even murder – of political activists, such as Steve Biko.One of the most important organisations to oppose the racist legislation was the African National Congress (ANC). As it became obvious that the white rulers were unwilling to undertake even the most cosmetic reforms, guerrilla warfare became the preferred option for the ANC. In the early 1960s, many ANC leaders were arrested, charged with treason and imprisoned for long periods; the most famous of those was Nelson Mandela.The system of apartheid was entrenched even further in the early 1970s by the creation of the so-called Black homelands of Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda. These were, in theory, ‘independent’ countries. By creating the homelands, all blacks within white-designated South Africa were deemed foreign guest-workers and as such were without political rights. Any black person without a residence pass could be ‘deported’ to a homeland.Meanwhile, South Africa was becoming an isolated case in the face of successful liberation struggles in Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, which brought Marxist-leaning governments into power. As a result, a war psychosis came to dominate government thinking, and resulted in the invasion of southern Angola by South African armed forces. The South African Government also gave encouragement to counter-revolutionary guerrilla groups in both Mozambique and Angola, and refused to enter into genuine negotiations for the independence of Namibia.The international community finally began to oppose the apartheid regime, and the UN imposed economic and political sanctions. The government made some concessions, including the establishment of a farcical new parliament of whites, coloureds (people of mixed race) and Indians – but no blacks.The ‘reforms’ did nothing to ease sanctions. After the 1989 elections the new president, FW de Klerk, instituted a program that was aimed not only at dismantling the apartheid system, but also at introducing democracy. The release of political prisoners on 11 February 1990 (including Nelson Mandela), the repeal of the Group Areas Act (which set up the homelands), and the signing of a peace accord with the ANC and other opposition groups all opened the way for hard-fought negotiations on the path to majority rule.</p>
<p>The country’s first democratic elections took place in 1994, and across the country at midnight on 26–27 April, Die Stem (the old national anthem) was sung and the old flag was lowered. A new rainbow flag was raised and the new anthem, Nkosi Sikelele Afrika (God Bless Africa), was sung. In the past people had been jailed for singing this beautiful anthem.In the first democratic election in the country’s history, the ANC won 62.7% of the vote; 66.7% would have enabled it to overrule the interim constitution. The National Party won 20.4% of the vote, enough to guarantee it representation in cabinet. Nelson Mandela was made president of the ‘new’ South Africa.In 1999, after five years of learning about democracy, the country voted in a more ‘normal’ election. Issues such as economics and competence were raised and debated.There was some speculation that the ANC vote might drop with the retirement of Nelson Mandela. However, the ANC’s vote increased to the point where the party came within one seat of the two-thirds majority that would allow it to alter the constitution. The National Party lost two-thirds of its seats, losing its official opposition status to the Democratic Party. Thabo Mbeki, who took over leadership of the ANC from Nelson Mandela, became president in the 1999 elections. While Mbeki is viewed with far less affection by the ANC grass-roots than the beloved ‘Madiba’ (Mandela), he has proven himself a shrewd politician, maintaining his political pre-eminence by isolating or co-opting opposition parties. The 2004 national elections were won decisively by the ANC with 70% of the votes, with Mbeki at the helm, and today continues its dominance in daily political life.Yet it has not been all clear sailing. In the early days of his presidency, Mbeki’s effective denial of the AIDS crisis invited global criticism, and his conspicuous failure to condemn the forced reclamation of white-owned farms in neighbouring Zimbabwe unnerved both South African landowners and foreign investors. </p>
<p>In the coming years – in addition to choosing a successor for Mbeki, who has announced that he will step down in 2009 – attention is likely to focus overwhelmingly on crime, economic inequality, overhauling the education system and, especially, AIDS. With an estimated 4.5 million South Africans affected – more than in any other country in the world – this scourge threatens to eclipse all of South Africa’s other problems. In many ways the real work of nation building is only now beginning. While the political violence that was threatening to engulf the country in the early 1990s has for the most part disappeared, racial and cultural divisions remain entrenched. Monuments, museums and other cultural heritage sites giving tribute to black South Africans and other previously excluded groups have been springing up across the country and filling a long vacant gap. Yet many have served to re-spark old tensions, and debate continues on all sides about which version of history is the ‘real’ one.Perhaps the biggest attention grabber in South Africa’s ongoing struggle to define itself as a nation has been Freedom Park – a multimillion dollar venture on the outskirts of Pretoria that is intended to give a sweeping overview of South African history. When finished, it will span the millennia from humankind’s earliest beginnings up to the present, including a memorial to apartheid-era freedom fighters. The park, which has been lauded by President Mbeki as the country’s most important national monument, is set directly opposite the Voortrekker Monument –for years an icon for most Afrikaners and a despised symbol of colonial-era injustices for many other South Africans.What’s the next step? While almost all South Africans agree that things are better than before, no-one has quite been able to agree on which way forward will best balance out the diversity that is the country’s greatest asset, as well as its biggest challenge. There has been talk of building a road joining Freedom Park and the Voortrekker Monument. If this road ultimately comes to be seen by those on all sides as a symbol of a united path into the future, then it will have truly captured the emerging spirit of the new South Africa and the country will be well on its way to rebuilding itself as a ‘rainbow nation’.</p>
<h3>Practical information</h3>
<h4>Health and safety</h4>
<h5>Dangers and annoyances</h5>
<p>Crime is the national obsession and, apart from car accidents, it’s the major risk that you’ll face in South Africa. However, try to keep things in perspective, and remember that despite the statistics and newspaper headlines, the majority of travellers visit the country without incident. The risks are highest in Jo’burg, followed by some township areas and other urban centres. Daylight muggings are common in certain sections of Jo’burg, and the city’s metro train system has had a problem with violent crime. No matter where you are, you can minimise the risks by following basic safety precautions, remaining alert and exercising common sense.If you are a victim of crime in South Africa, it's most likely to occur at an ATM. There are dozens of scams that involve stealing your cash, your card or your personal identification number (PIN) - usually all three. Thieves are just as likely to operate in Stellenbosch as in downtown Jo'burg and they are almost always well-dressed and well-mannered men. The ATM scam you're most likely to encounter involves the thief tampering with the machine so your card becomes jammed. By the time you realise this you've entered your PIN. The thief will have seen this, and when you go inside to report that your card has been swallowed, he will take the card - along with several thousand rand. Choose the ATM you use carefully, and try to avoid using them at night and/or in secluded places.


</p>
<h4>Money and costs</h4>
<h5>Money</h5>
<p>South Africa’s currency is the rand (R), which is divided into 100 cents. There is no black market. The coins are one, two, five, 10, 20 and 50 cents, and R1, R2 and R5. The notes are R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200. There have been forgeries of the R200 note, and some businesses are reluctant to accept them.The best currencies to bring are US dollars, euros or British pounds in a mixture of travellers cheques and cash, plus a Visa or MasterCard for withdrawing money from ATMs.There are ATMs in all cities in South Africa, most of which give cash advances against cards belonging to the Cirrus network. Credit cards are widely accepted in South Africa, especially MasterCard and Visa. Nedbank is an official Visa agent, and Standard Bank is a MasterCard agent – both have branches across the country.</p>
<h4>Visas</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Visitors on holiday from most Commonwealth countries (including Australia and the UK), most Western European countries, Japan and the USA don’t require visas. Instead, you’ll be issued with a free entry permit on arrival. These are valid for a stay of up to 90 days.If you aren’t entitled to an entry permit, you’ll need to get a visa (also free) before you arrive. These aren’t issued at the borders, and must be obtained at a South African embassy or consulate. Allow up to several weeks for processing. South Africa has consular representation in most countries. The website of the South African High Commission in London (<a href="http://www.southafricahouse.com">www.southafricahouse.com</a>) has an overview of visa requirements, and lists the nationalities that require visas. </p>
<h5>Other</h5>
<p>Visas for Namibia are not issued at the border, though many nationalities don’t require one. Visas for Zimbabwe and Mozambique are available at the borders. (South African nationals don’t need a visa for Mozambique.) For Mozambique it’s cheaper to arrange your visa in advance at the Mozambican High Commission in Mbabane, or in Nelspruit. Both issue express visas in 24 hours.If you’ll be arranging your visa in advance: Zimbabwean visas take at least a week to issue in South Africa; those for Namibia take two to three days; and those for Botswana take between four and 14 days. Nonexpress Mozambique visas take one week.</p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<h4>Getting around</h4>
<h5>Air</h5>
<p>In addition to being the international flag carrier, South African Airways (SAA; 0861-359 722, 011-978 5313; <a href="http://www.flysaa.com">www.flysaa.com</a>) is the main domestic carrier, with an extensive and efficient route network to major cities. Its subsidiaries, SAAirlink (011-978 5313; <a href="http://www.saairlink.co.za">www.saairlink.co.za</a>) and SA Express (011-978 5577; <a href="http://www.saexpress.co.za">www.saexpress.co.za</a>), also service domestic routes. Domestic fares aren’t cheap. In addition to SAA and its affiliates, airlines flying domestically include the following:1time (0861-345345; <a href="http://www.1time.co.za">www.1time.co.za</a>) No-frills flights linking Jo’burg with Cape Town, Durban and East London, George and Port Elizabeth, and Cape Town and East London. Also offers car rentals.Comair (0860-435 922, 011-921 0222; <a href="http://www.comair.co.za">www.comair.co.za</a>) Operates British Airways flights within Africa, and has flights linking Cape Town, Durban, Jo’burg and Port Elizabeth.Kulula.com (0861-585 852; <a href="http://www.kulula.com">www.kulula.com</a>) Operates no-frills flights linking Jo’burg, Cape Town, Durban, George, Port Elizabeth and Mpumalanga. Also offers airport transfer services and car rentals.Nationwide Airlines (0861 -737 737, 011-344 7200; <a href="http://www.nationwideair.co.za">www.nationwideair.co.za</a>) Operates in partnership with Virgin Atlantic, and has flights linking Jo’burg, Cape Town, Durban, George, Port Elizabeth, Sun City and Nelspruit.</p>
<h5>Bus and tram</h5>
<p>Buses in South Africa aren’t the deal that they are in many other countries. However, together with the less-appealing minibus taxis, they’re the main form of public transport, with a reliable and reasonably comfortable network linking all major cities. Note that many long-distance services run through the night. A good alternative to standard bus lines is Baz Bus (021-439 2323; <a href="http://www.bazbus.com">www.bazbus.com</a>), which caters almost exclusively to backpackers and other travellers. It offers hop-on, hop-off fares and door-to-door service between Cape Town and Jo’burg via the Northern Drakensberg, Durban and the Garden Route. It also has a loop service from Durban via Zululand and Swaziland to Jo’burg, passing close by Kruger National Park. Point-to-point fares are more expensive than on the other major bus lines, but can work out to be more economical if you take advantage of the hop-on/hop-off feature. Along with the main long-distance bus operator Translux (011-774 3333, 0861-589 282; <a href="http://www.translux.co.za">www.translux.co.za</a>), Greyhound (083-915 -1200; <a href="http://www.greyhound.co.za">www.greyhound.co.za</a>), Intercape Mainliner (0861-287 287, 021-380 4400; <a href="http://www.intercape.co.za">www.intercape.co.za</a>) and SA Roadlink (011-333 2223; <a href="http://www.saroadlink.co.za">www.saroadlink.co.za</a>) have services connecting most of the major cities. In partnership with Translux, City to City (011-774 3333, 0861-589 282; <a href="http://www.translux.co.za">www.translux.co.za</a>) has taken over the routes that once carried people from the homelands to and from the big cities during the apartheid regime. Prices rise during school holidays; all lines offer student and senior-citizen discounts, and Intercape has backpacker discounts. Also inquire about travel passes if you’ll be taking several bus journeys, and always check with the bus companies to see if they are running any specials, which can sometimes save you up to 40%.For the main lines, reservations should be made at least 24 hours in advance (72 hours in advance for Intercape Mainliner, and as much in advance as possible for travel during peak periods). It’s sometimes possible to get a seat at the last minute, but this shouldn’t be counted on.</p>
<p>Cape Town, Jo’burg, Pretoria and several other urban areas have city bus systems. Fares are cheap, and routes, which are signposted, are extensive. However, services usually stop running early in the evening, and there aren’t many buses on weekends.</p>
<h5>Car and motorcycle</h5>
<p>South Africa is ideal for driving, and away from the main bus and train routes, having your own wheels is the best way to get around. If you’re in a group, it’s also often the most economical. Most major roads are in excellent condition, and off the main routes there are interesting back roads to explore. Driving is on the left-hand side of the road, as in the UK, Japan and Australia. Petrol costs around US$0.70 per litre, and must be paid for in cash. There is no self-service. An attendant will always fill up your tank for you, clean your windows and ask if the oil or water needs checking, and should be tipped between US$0.30 and US$0.70. Along main routes in South Africa there are plenty of petrol stations, many open 24 hours. South Africa has a horrific road-accident record, with the annual death toll around 10,000 (although some estimates place it at over 15,000). The N1 between Cape Town and Beaufort West is considered to be the most dangerous stretch of road in the country. The main hazards are your fellow drivers, though animals and pedestrians on the roads are another hazard, especially in rural areas. </p>
<p>Car rental is relatively inexpensive in South Africa. Rates start at about US$40 per day, including insurance and 200km free per day. Rental of a 4WD starts at about US$60. For cheaper rates and unlimited mileage deals, it’s best to book and prepay through your agent at home before coming to South Africa.

<h5>Local transport</h5>
<p>Minibus taxis run almost everywhere – within cities, to the suburbs and to neighbouring towns. They leave when full and, happily, ‘full’ in South Africa isn’t as full as it is in many neighbouring countries. Most accommodate 14 to 16 people. Driving standards and vehicle conditions often leave a lot to be desired, and there are many accidents. There are also isolated outbreaks of gangster-style shoot-outs between the various companies competing for business. Although things have settled down in recent years, minibuses in some areas and on some routes are still considered highly unsafe, and reports of muggings and other incidents remain a regular feature. Always ask for local advice on lines and areas to avoid before using minibus taxis as transport.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Shosholoza Meyl passenger trains are run by Spoornet (011-773 2944; <a href="http://www.spoornet.co.za">www.spoornet.co.za</a>), and offer regular services connecting major cities. These are a good and safe, albeit slow, way to get around, and are more comfortable than taking the bus.On overnight journeys, 1st- and 2nd-class fares include a sleeping berth, but there’s an additional charge for bedding hire. Alternatively, you can hire a private compartment (which sleeps four in 1st class and six in 2nd class) or a coupe (which sleeps two in 1st class and three in 2nd class) – these are a good way of travelling more securely. Meals are available in the dining car.Tickets must be booked at least 24 hours in advance (you can book up to three months in advance). Bookings for anywhere in the country can be done at any individual station, or through the Shosholoza Meyl Reservations Centre (0860-008 888, 011-774 4555). Sample 1st-/2nd-/economy-class fares include: Jo’burg–Durban (US$34/22/13), Cape Town–Pretoria (US$70/47/31), Jo’burg–Port Elizabeth (US$49/33/20). Return fares are double the one-way fares. It’s possible to put a vehicle on board the Trans Karoo for an extra US$180.</p>
<h4>Getting there and away</h4>
<h5>Air</h5>
<p>The major air hub for South Africa, and for the entire surrounding region, is Johannesburg International Airport (JIA or JNB; 011-921 6262; <a href="http://www.worldairportguides.com/johannesburg-jnb">www.worldairportguides.com/johannesburg-jnb</a>). Cape Town International Airport (CPT; 021-937 1200; <a href="http://www.airports.co.za">www.airports.co.za</a>) receives numerous direct flights from Europe, and is becoming an increasingly important gateway. The smaller Durban International Airport (DUR; 031-451 6758; <a href="http://www.airports.co.za">www.airports.co.za</a>) handles several regional flights, as does Mpumalanga Kruger International Airport (MQP; 013-753 7500; <a href="http://www.kmiairport.co.za">www.kmiairport.co.za</a>) near Nelspruit and Kruger National Park. South African Airways (SAA; airline code SA; 0861-359 722, 011-978 5313; <a href="http://www.flysaa.com">www.flysaa.com</a>; hub JIA) is the national airline, with an excellent route network and safety record. In addition to its international routes, it operates regional flights together with its subsidiaries South African Airlink (SAAirlink; 011-978 5313; <a href="http://www.saairlink.co.za">www.saairlink.co.za</a>) and South African Express (011-978 5577; <a href="http://www.saexpress.co.za">www.saexpress.co.za</a>).

<p>From Jo’burg/Pretoria, Intercape Mainliner (0861 287 287, 021-380 4400; <a href="http://www.intercape.co.za">www.intercape.co.za</a>) runs daily buses to Gaborone (US$20, six hours). A cheaper, but less safe and less comfortable, alternative is one of the minibuses that run throughout the day between Jo’burg and Gaborone (about US$1.40, six hours) via Mafikeng (North-West Province). In Jo’burg, departures are from Park Station. To do the trip in stages, take a City Link bus from Jo’burg to Mafikeng, from where there are direct minibuses over the border to Lobatse (1½ hours). </p>
<p>Big Sky Coaches (<a href="http://www.bigskycoaches.co.za">www.bigskycoaches.co.za</a>) runs two buses daily in each direction between Bloemfontein and Maseru Bridge (US$4.70, three hours). Via minibus taxi, the quickest connections are from Bloemfontein to Botshabelo (US$4, one hour), and then from there to Maseru (US$2, 1½ hours). There are also at least three buses weekly between Jo’burg and Maseru (six to seven hours). Other useful connections include a daily minibus taxi between Mokhotlong (Lesotho) and Underberg (South Africa) via Sani Pass; and several taxis daily between Qacha’s Nek (Lesotho) and Matatiele (South Africa; about US$2, 45 minutes). </p>
<p>Several large ‘luxury’ buses run daily between Jo’burg/Pretoria and Maputo via Nelspruit and Komatipoort (US$20 to US$38, eight to nine hours). These include Greyhound, Intercape Mainliner, Panthera Azul and Translux. Panthera Azul connects Durban and Maputo (US$31, 8½ hours).Alternatively, the Baz Bus (021-439 2323; <a href="http://www.bazbus.com">www.bazbus.com</a>) links Jo’burg/Pretoria, Nelspruit and Durban with Manzini (Swaziland), from where you can get a minibus taxi to Maputo. The daily (except Saturday) Komati train operated by Shosholoza Meyl (0860-008 888, 011-774 4555) links Jo’burg and Komatipoort via Pretoria and Nelspruit (1st/2nd/3rd class from US$25/17/9, 13 to 14 hours). Once at Komatipoort, you can change to the Mozambican train to Maputo (Mtc15, 000, economy class only, five hours), but it’s better to take a minibus (US$3.50, 1½ hours). Visas for Mozambique are available at the borders. (South African nationals don’t need a visa for Mozambique.) It’s cheaper to arrange your visa in advance at the Mozambican High Commission in Mbabane, or in Nelspruit. Both issue express visas in 24 hours. Nonexpress Mozambique visas take one week.</p>
<p>Intercape Mainliner (<a href="http://www.intercape.co.za">www.intercape.co.za</a>) runs four times weekly between Cape Town and Windhoek via Upington (US$65, 20 hours). It’s also possible to travel between Jo’burg and Windhoek with Intercape Mainliner (US$83, 25 hours) on these same days, with a change of buses in Upington.</p>
<p>The best connections are on the Baz Bus (021-439 2323; <a href="http://www.bazbus.com">www.bazbus.com</a>), which runs from Jo’burg/Pretoria to Manzini via Nelspruit, and between Durban and Manzini via the KwaZulu-Natal coast.Minibus taxis run daily between Jo’burg (Park Station), Mbabane and Manzini (US$0.90, four hours), between Manzini and Durban (US$16, eight hours), and between Manzini and Maputo (Mozambique; US$4.50, 2½ hours). </p>
<p>At the time of research, bus services between Jo’burg and Zimbabwe were suspended, due in part to fuel shortages. </p>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<h4>When to go</h4>
<h5>Climate</h5>
<p>South Africa has been favoured by nature with one of the most temperate climates on the African continent, and can be visited comfortably any time. Winter (June to September) is cooler and drier, and ideal for hiking and outdoor pursuits. Because vegetation is less dense, and thirsty animals congregate around water sources, winter is also the best time for wildlife-watching. Summer (late November to March) brings rain, mists and – in the lowveld – some uncomfortably hot days. Along the Indian Ocean coast, conditions are sultry and tropical, with high humidity. More of a consideration than weather are school holidays. From mid-December to January, waves of vacation-hungry South Africans stream out of the cities, with visitors from Europe and North America adding to the crush. The absolute peak is from Christmas to mid-January, followed by Easter. Accommodation in tourist areas and national parks is heavily booked, and prices can increase by more than double. Spring (mid-September to November) and autumn (April and May) are ideal almost every­where. Spring is also the best time to see vast expanses of Northern Cape carpeted with wildflowers.</p>
<h3>Wildlife</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>South Africa encompasses one of the most diverse landscapes on the entire continent, with habitats ranging from verdant forests, to stony deserts and soaring mountains, to lush grasslands and classic African savannahs. It is home to penguins and flamingos, great white sharks and ponderous African elephants, and many more animals that will surprise and amaze visitors. There are over 700 publicly owned preserves (including 19 national parks) and about 200 private reserves, with Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park being the largest. </p>
<h4>Animals</h4>
<h5>Mammals</h5>
<p> South Africa is home to an unparalleled diversity of wildlife. It boasts the world's largest land mammal (the African elephant), as well as the second largest (white rhino) and the third largest (hippopotamus). It's also home to the tallest (giraffe), the fastest (cheetah) and the smallest (pygmy shrew). You probably have a better chance of seeing the Big Five - the black rhino, Cape buffalo, elephant, leopard and lion - in South Africa than anywhere else. There's also a lesser-known 'Little Five' - the rhinoceros beetle, buffalo weaver, elephant shrew, leopard tortoise and ant lion - if you're looking for a challenge.   The best time for wildlife-watching is the cooler, dry winter (June to September) when foliage is less dense, and animals congregate at waterholes, making spotting easier. Summer (late November to March) is rainy and hot, with the animals more widely dispersed and often difficult to see. However, the landscape turns beautiful shades of green around this time and birdlife is abundant. </p>
<h4>Birds</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p> South Africa hosts over 800 bird species, including the world's largest bird (the ostrich), its heaviest flying bird (Kori bustard), and vividly coloured sunbirds and flamingos. Also here in abundance are weavers, who share their huge city-like nests with pygmy falcons, the world's smallest raptors. Bird-watching is good year-round, with spring (August to November) and summer the best.
</p>
<h4>Endangered species</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p> The black rhino is the highest profile entry on South Africa's threatened species list (good places to spot these include Mkhuze Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park. The riverine rabbit is the country's most endangered mammal (the only place in the world it is found is near rivers in the central Karoo). The wild dog (seen with luck in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park) is also endangered, as is the roan antelope.
Endangered bird species include the graceful wattled crane and the blue swallow. The African penguin and the Cape vulture are considered threatened. 
</p>
<h4>Plants</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p> Over 20,000 plant species sprout from South Africa's soil - an amazing 10% of the world's total, although the country constitutes only 1% of the earth's land surface.  Dozens of flowers that are domesticated elsewhere grow wild here, including gladiolus, proteas, birds of paradise and African lilies. South Africa is also the only country with one of the world's six floral kingdoms within its borders.  In the drier northwest, there are succulents (dominated by euphorbias and aloes), and annuals, which flower brilliantly after the spring rains, and are one of Northern Cape's major tourist attractions.  In contrast to this floral wealth, South Africa has few natural forests. They were never extensive, and today only remnants remain. Temperate forests occur on the southern coastal strip between George and Humansdorp, in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg and in Mpumalanga. Subtropical forests are found northeast of Port Elizabeth in the areas just inland from the Wild Coast, and in KwaZulu-Natal. In the north are large areas of savanna, dotted with acacias and thorn trees.
