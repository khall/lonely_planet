<h3>Introductory</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Billed as the heritage city, and KZN’s administrative and legislative capital (previously shared with Ulundi), Pietermaritzburg’s (usually known as ‘PMB’) grand historic buildings hark back to an age of pith helmets and midday martinis. By day, the city is vibrant: its large Zulu community sets a colourful flavour and the Indian community brings echoes of the subcontinent to its busy streets. A large student population adds to the city’s vitality.Pietermaritzburg is where you need to book most of the accommodation and walks for KwaZulu-Natal Parks. The KZN Wildlife Headquarters (845 1000; <a href="http://www.kznwildlife.com">www.kznwildlife.com</a>; Queen Elizabeth Park, Duncan McKenzie Dr; 8am-5pm Mon-Fri, 8am-noon Sat) is a long way northwest of the town centre.</p>
