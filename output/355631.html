<h3>Introductory</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Sudan’s only major industrial port is the base for some of the Red Sea’s best diving. Port Sudan Tourism (0311-8-22927; <a href="http://www.portsudantourism.com">www.portsudantourism.com</a>) can put you in touch with local captains. On land, watching ships unload in the port is about as exciting as it gets in this sprawling but surprisingly laid-back city, though strolling the streets reveals some scattered colonial buildings. All the services you might need are here, including foreign exchange and fast internet access, but despite its prosperity, power and water are unreliable.</p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<h4>Getting there and away</h4>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Minibuses (SDD250, 45 minutes) for Suakin leave from the city centre. The major bus companies serving Kassala (SDD3500, six hours) and Khartoum (SDD9000, 13 hours) have offices in the city centre and at the bus station (Souq esh-Shabi). Buses for Atbara (SDD4000, 10 hours) have their own bus station nearby. Minibuses (SDD50) from the city centre drop you nearly 1km away from the main bus station, so consider a taxi (SDD400).The train to Atbara (1st/2nd class SDD4300/3300) departs sometime around the 8th of each month, and there are daily flights to/from Khartoum (SDD21, 000, one hour). Sudan Airways’ Saturday flight to Cairo stops in Port Sudan on the way.</p>
